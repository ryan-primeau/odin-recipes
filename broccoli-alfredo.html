    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This vibrant broccoli Alfredo pasta looks delightful when made with farfalle, also known as bow-tie pasta, though fettuccine
     is a perfect substitute if you prefer. As a main course, it serves two, while as a side dish, it serves four. Pair it with a 
     fresh salad and some crusty bread for a complete meal. We especially love it as a side alongside grilled chicken or shrimp for 
     a satisfying, well-rounded plate.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 ounces farfalle pasta</li>
        <li>2 cups fresh broccoli florets</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg, or to taste</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>fresh parsley sprigs for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook farfalle pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until tender 
        yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Remove to a colander; reserve the pasta water for later use.</li>
        <li>Add broccoli to a microwave-safe container along with 1/4 cup water. Cover and cook on High until bright green and tender 
        with a bite, about 4 minutes. Drain; season with salt. Keep warm.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a skillet or saucepan over low heat. Stir in cream and allow to simmer, stirring often, 3 to 4 
        minutes.</li>
        <li>Add cheese and garlic, stirring continuously, until cheese is melted. Stir in nutmeg and remove from heat. sauce is too 
        thick, stir in a bit of reserved pasta water. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>To serve, combine cooked pasta, cooked broccoli, and sauce. Garnish with fresh parsley sprigs, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
