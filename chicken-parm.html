    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the sauce: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes. 
        Add crushed tomatoes, chicken broth, wine, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, and sugar; season
         with salt and pepper. Stir to combine, reduce the heat to low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens, about 15 minutes. 
         Keep warm until needed.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is cooking, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add rigatoni and cook, stirring occasionally, until 
        tender yet firm to the bite, about 13 minutes. Drain and keep warm.</li>
        <li>At the same time, start the chicken: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Set out three large mixing bowls for breading chicken. Combine flour, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper in the first 
        bowl. Whisk together eggs and milk in the second bowl. Combine bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, oregano, Italian seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 
        and 1/4 teaspoon salt in the third bowl.</li>
        <li>Place chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag and flatten with a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/4 inch. Dredge a chicken breast in flour 
        mixture and shake off excess. Dip into egg mixture, then coat with bread crumb mixture. Place onto a plate. Repeat to bread remaining chicken.</li>
        <li>Fill a large, cast iron skillet with 1 inch oil; heat over medium-high heat until oil is hot but not smoking. Add breaded chicken in batches; 
        cook until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle mozzarella and Parmesan over chicken.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F (74 degrees C) and the cheeses have melted, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Plate pasta portions. Stir basil into sauce and ladle over pasta. Top each portion with chicken.</li>
